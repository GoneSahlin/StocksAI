### Overview
* Predicting percent increase of a stock over the next day
* Collects the stockâ€™s price and quarterly financials
* Collects index data for broader view of market
* Uses time-series forecasting to take the previous 10 days to predict the next day.

### Results
![Accuracy Plot](./plots/accuracy_chart.png)

None of the models were able to predict with more accuracy than the model predicting zero change.

### Potential Problems
* Inconsistencies in the stock market over the last two years of data. Previous ten years showed steady increase, but over the last two years stock prices decreased.
* Lack of data. Might be improved with more stocks, a longer time period, and more attributes.
